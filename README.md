This is a network utility tool that I developed to perform some network and security administrator tasks. Currently, this script can perform a good variety of tasks such as:
- Port scans, including SYN, TCP, UDP, ACK, comprehensive scan;
- Host discovery (scan for local devices on a network);
- Banner grabbing;
- DNS checks with geolocation information;
- ifconfig;
- ping;
- traceroute;
- DDOS (still in beta).

Other features are still being implemented. Future implementations may include WAP (web application firewall) detection, vulnerability reconnaissance, static code analysis, traffic analysis, offensive tasks such as packet sniffing, ARP poisoning, exploits, some automated tasks and others.

To install the necessary packages so that the script can run withouth any problems simply run the `setup.sh` script. Currently, this script is only supported on debian based distros that has the apt package manager. If you are using any other Linux distro with a different package manager, please install the packages manually using your distro's package manager. Depending on the specific distro used, some of the required packages to run this script might be already installed on your machine.

To run the program simply run the `medsec.py` file using python. Running the script as root is recommended for better performance and to avoid permission errors.
